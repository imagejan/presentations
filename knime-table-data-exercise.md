### Working with table data

1. Open the provided [csv file](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/imagejan/presentations/v1.0.0/data/table-data.csv) using the *CSV Reader* node
2. Inspect the results table (by right-clicking on the node)
3. Split the table rows in two parts: classes *c1-5*, and classes *c6-7*
4. Use a Box Plot to get a first grasp of the data distribution
5. Display a scatter plot of the first partition (*c1-c5*)
6. Color the data points by color (using *Color Manager*)
7. Use the *Line Plot* and *Scatter Plot* nodes to visualize the data
